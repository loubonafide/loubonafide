It was 2018 when I first heard about Bitcoin. I had no idea about cryptocurrency, no one told me and I didn’t care about it.

2019 when I was browsing the StockTwits app. A fellow user posted his invitation code to join <a href="https://minepi.com/Bonafide">Pi Network</a> a cryptocurrency that you can (mine) earn through your phone. I joined using  his invite code. I got involved in the chatroom, I met new people and my interest in cryptocurrency started to grow.

Prior to this I was working hard to payoff my debt. I have no financial background whatsoever, what I have is the feeling of hate about debt. I hated debt because I worked 3 jobs and just had enough to get by. I did educate myself about personal finance, how to manage your finances and how to get out of debt. I read about cryptocurrency  and how the blockchain works and the rest is history.

Now I want to learn github and coding, let's see where will destiny takes me.
